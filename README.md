Project Description: Puff-Up Project is a multi-person experiment that gives a physical and sensory form to the experience of human anxiety and introversion. Starting from the question “What happens when you go into panic mode?” we built a wearable Arduino device that measures the proximity of the people around you. When someone gets too close the plastic collar puffs up like the neck of a frightened lizard and a mood indicator flips from a calming blue colour to an aggressive red.
